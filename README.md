# Hand-Gesture-Tracking
This repo contains a project for live hand gesture tracking using OpenCV and Mediapipe.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
MediaPipe is a cross-platform framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines.The MediaPipe Holistic pipeline integrates separate models for pose, face and hand components, each of which are optimized for their particular domain.
